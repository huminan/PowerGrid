PSAP File Format

May 20, 1993

The PECO PSAP File Format is fully described in the _PJM Power System
Analysis Package Use's Guide_, available from the Philadelphia
Electric Company. The following is a rough description of the
most important parts of the format.

A PSAP data file is divided into sections by code cards. The code is
in the first three columns. There are something like 60 codes, of
which only four are described in this document.

The 1 code indicates that the next card is the case title. Only one
title is allowed per case.

The 4 card indicates that line data follows. The line data ends with
a 9999 card.

The 5 card indicates that bus data follows. The bus data ends with
a 9999 card.

The 15 card indicates that area interchange data follows. The data ends with
a 9999 card.

Line Data Card (Code 4 cards)
=============================

Cols    Data
1-4     From bus number     (源节点) 0
6       Change code (blank in 4 section)
7       'C' if second card present for same line. Used for transformers.    (有'C'就是变压器)
9-12    To bus number       (目标节点) 3
14      Circuit number (blank in 4 section)
16      'T' or 'F' - Load flow area of bus at this end of line gets losses.
18-23   Line resistance in percent of base. (NOT per unit.)     (线路电阻) 6
        (percent = 100 x per unit) Two default decimal places.
24-29   Line reactance, in percent. Two default decimal places. (线路电抗)  7
30-35   Line charging MVAR (total). Three default decimal places.
36-40   Transformer tap (per unit turns ratio). Three default decimal
        places, 1000 = 1.000.
41-45   Min tap, for OLTC. Three default decimal places.
46-50   Max tap, for OLTC. Three default decimal places.
51-55   Phase shift angle, for OL phase shifter. Two default decimal places.        (移相角) 12
56-60   Remote voltage control bus number. Negative if lower tap increases
        voltage of this bus.
61-64   Normal MVA rating
65-68   Emergency MVA rating
69-72   MVA Base. Default value 100 MVA if blank.

Second Line Card (follows 'C' in first card)
============================================

1-17    Same as first card, except no 'C'. Can be left blank.
35-40   Desired MVAR flow or Min voltage setpoint for OLTC.
41-45   Min phase shifter degrees. Two default decimal places.
46-50   Max phase shifter degrees. Two default decimal places.
51-55   Desired MW flow for phase shifter.
57-60   Controlled line from bus.
62-65   Controlled line to bus.
67-70   Available taps (number of taps)
71-75   Maximum voltage setpoint. Three default decimal places.

Bus Cards (Code 5 cards)
========================

1-4     Bus number
6       Change code (blank in 5 section)
7       Continue code (blank in 5 section)
8       Regulated bus code:
         Blank - load (PQ) bus
         1     - gen (PV) bus
         2     - swing (V-Theta) bus
10-21   Name
23-26   Bus voltage (control setpoint or solved value).
        Three default decimal places.
27-30   Bus angle
31-35   Generation MW
36-40   Generation MVAR (from solution)
41-45   Generation MVAR low limit
46-50   Generation MVAR high limit
51-55   Bus at which generation controls voltage
56-60   Load MW
61-65   Load MVAR
66-70   Shunt MVAR. Reactors are minus.
71-72   Load flow area. (Used for area interchange and losses).

Area Interchange Cards (Code 15 cards)
======================================

3-4     Load flow area number
5-8     Swing bus for area interchange. Adjusts generation at this bus
        to meet area interchange requirement.
9-14    Area exports, MW. (+ = out of area)
15-19   Area Interchange tolerance, MW
20-55   Area name
56-60   Area load (usually left blank)
61-65   Area losses (usually left blank)
